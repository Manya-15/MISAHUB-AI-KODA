# Flutter App

## Project Overview

This Flutter app is designed to [describe the purpose of your app]. It includes features such as [list key features].

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the app on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK: [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK: Comes with Flutter
- Android Studio or Xcode: For running the app on an emulator or physical device
- Firebase account: For backend services
- Hive: For local storage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Check whether flutter is ready for use: 
    ```bash
    flutter doctor
    ```
    Resolve any issues shown by flutter doctor before moving to next steps


3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

### Running the App

1. Connect your device or start an emulator.

2. Run the app:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

### Firebase Setup

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2. Add an Android app to your Firebase project. Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `android/app` directory.

3. Add an iOS app to your Firebase project. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and place it in the `ios/Runner` directory.

4. Modify the `pubspec.yaml` file to include the necessary Firebase dependencies:
    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      firebase_core: latest_version
      firebase_auth: latest_version
      cloud_firestore: latest_version
    ```

5. Initialize Firebase in your Flutter project. Update the `main.dart` file:
    ```dart
    import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

    void main() async {
      WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
      await Firebase.initializeApp();
      runApp(MyApp());
    }
    ```

### Hive Setup

1. Add Hive dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      hive: latest_version
      hive_flutter: latest_version

    dev_dependencies:
      hive_generator: latest_version
      build_runner: latest_version
    ```

2. Initialize Hive in your `main.dart` file:
    ```dart
    import 'package:hive/hive.dart';
    import 'package:hive_flutter/hive_flutter.dart';

    void main() async {
      WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
      await Hive.initFlutter();
      runApp(MyApp());
    }
    ```

3. Generate Hive TypeAdapters (if needed for your models).
